## Prerequisite
- [Docker(Compose)](https://docs.docker.com)

## Build docker image
```sh
docker-compose build
```

## Crawl public product's info from an e-commerce
The spider script collect product info from Petlove's site.
After spider script has finished, a `dataset.csv` file will be generated to `data/external` directory.
```
  docker-compose run web make crawl_petlove
```

## Datasets
- A public dataset of `1980 products` with `88 categories` extracted from `Petlove`, each product has `name`, `description` and `category` - https://s3.amazonaws.com/product-categorization/dataset.csv
